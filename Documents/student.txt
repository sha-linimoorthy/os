The objective of this project is to implement a machine learning model which improves the mental health of people by sentiment analysis. Users of social networking sites can post anything and everything to the virtual world, besides nowadays people express their mental and physical well-being in the internet community. There is a wealth of unstructured, free-text information contemplating the quality of people’s thoughts that are not systematically assembled from social networks. We use this data to raise the standard of people’s mental stability. By sentiment analysis, we would categorize the obtained text comments as positive or negative by the classifier model. Then we would come to an end as if the person needs mental welfare and bring forth the help they are in need of. We provide website links according to their mental state identified using the keywords that would make them feel better like YouTube videos and 
quizzes which soothe their health.
